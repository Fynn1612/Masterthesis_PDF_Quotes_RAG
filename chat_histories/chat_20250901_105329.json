    "question": "What is epistemic uncertainty",
    "answer": "Epistemic uncertainty is the type of uncertainty that can be alleviated with more data, making it reducible. It captures the lack of knowledge of the learner or model, and if the model had more information, it could provide a more accurate representation of the data. This type of uncertainty is associated with areas in the data that have little to no data, causing the model to make predictions without having seen similar data. It can also be understood as the reducible part of the total uncertainty.\n\nSources:\n* A Structured Review of Literature on Uncertainty in Machine.pdf (page_content: Figure 5), (page_content: 3. Uncertainty Categorizations: Epistemic vs Aleatoric Uncertainty)\n* How to measure uncertainty in uncertainty sampling.pdf (page_content: Consequently, querying an instance with a high epistemic uncer‑ tainty may provide useful information for the learner, whereas an aleatorically uncertain instance is unlikely to do so.), (page_content: Roughly speaking, aleatoric uncertainty is due to inherent ran‑ domness, whereas epistemic uncertainty captures the lack of knowledge of the learner. Thus, the latter corresponds to the reducible and the former to the irreducible part of the total uncertainty in a prediction.), (page_content: Or, stated differently, ue and ua measure the reducible and the irreducible part of the total uncertainty, respectively.)\n* A Structured Review of Literature on Uncertainty in Machine.pdf (page_content: [6] considers the model uncertainty to be the epistemic part of the predictive uncertainty; if the model had more information, it could give a more accurate representation of the data, so the model uncertainty is reducible.)"
